              Make the crust:Using a food proecssor, pulse the graham checkers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and
              melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food processor). Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly
              into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the
              bottom ofa measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on
              a large piece of aluminium foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool
              as you prepare the filling.

              Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar
              together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream,
              vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time beating after
              each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the
              cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

              Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water
              bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminium foil
              around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an
              even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the
              oven.

              Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it's done, the center of the cheesecake will
              slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the
              oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at
              room temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.

              Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp
              knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice
